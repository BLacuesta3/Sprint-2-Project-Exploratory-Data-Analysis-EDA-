Project Title: Sprint 2/ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

Project Description: This project is a basic Python project that involves Exploratory Data analysis (EDA).  This project uses
data from the enterainment industry.  The datasets that are included in this project are:  'instacart_orders (1).csv', 'products.csv',
'departments.csv', and 'order_products (1).csv'.  This project involves: examining each dataset's missing and duplicate values, dealing with
each dataset's missing and duplicate values appropriately, and solving questions/ propsed tasks with the use of: histograms and data analysis. 

Project Datasets:
* instacart_orders (1).csv
* products.csv
* departments.csv
* order_products (1).csv

Project Methodolgy:
   1) Importing Necessary Libraries And Reading/ Uploading The Datasets
      
   2) Examining Each Dataset's Missing And Duplicate Values
   
   3) Dealing With Each Dataset's Missing And Duplicate Values Appropriately
      
   4) Easy Project Tasks (Must Complete All To Pass):
      * Solving Easy Project Task: [A1] Verify that the 'order_hour_of_day' and 'order_dow' values in the orders tables are sensible
      (i.e. 'order_hour_of_day' ranges from 0 to 23 and 'order_dow' ranges from 0 to 6)

      * Solving Easy Project Task: [A2] What time of day do people shop for groceries?

      * Solving Easy Project Task: [A3] What day of the week do people shop for groceries?

      * Solving Project Task: [A4] How long do people wait until placing another order?

   5) Medium Project Tasks (Must Complete All To Pass):
      * Solving Medium Project Task: [B1] Is there a difference in 'order_hour_of_day' distributions on Wednesdays and Saturdays?
        Plot the histograms for both days and describe the differences that you see.

      * Solving Medium Project Task: [B2] What's the distribution for the number of orders per customer?

      * Solving Medium Project Task: [B3] What are the top 20 popular products (display their id and name)?

  6) Hard Project Tasks (Must Complete At Least Two To Pass):
      * Solving Hard Project Task: [C1] How many items do people typically buy in one order? What does the distribution look like?

      * Solving Hard Project Task: [C2] What are the top 20 items that are reordered most frequently (display their names and product IDs)?
